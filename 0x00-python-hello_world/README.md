# 0x00 Python - Hello, World
## This project is about introducing Python, with tasks that help with learning about the programming language and using it as well. Below are the tasks and the points I needed to follow to complete each task (From Holberton's intranet):
***0. Run Python file***
- Write a Shell script that runs a Python script.\
***1. Run inline***
- Write a Shell script that runs Python code.
***2. Hello, print***
- Write a Python script that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line.
***3. Print integer***
- Complete this source code in order to print the integer stored in the variable number, followed by Battery street, followed by a new line.
***4. Print float***
- Complete the source code in order to print the float stored in the variable number with a precision of 2 digits.
***5. Print string***
- Complete this source code in order to print 3 times a string stored in the variable str, followed by its first 9 characters.
***6. Play with strings***
- Complete this source code to print Welcome to Holberton School!
***7. Copy - Cut - Paste***
- You can find the source code here
- You are not allowed to use any loops or conditional statements
- Your program should be exactly 8 lines long
- word_first_3 should contain the first 3 letters of the variable word
- word_last_2 should contain the last 2 letters of the variable word
- middle_word should contain the value of the variable word without the first and last letters
***8. Create a new sentence***
- You can find the source code here
- You are not allowed to use any loops or conditional statements
- Your program should be exactly 5 lines long
- You are not allowed to create new variables
- You are not allowed to use string literals
***9. Easter Egg***
- Write a Python script that prints The Zen of Python, by TimPeters, followed by a new line.
- Your script should be maximum 98 characters long (please check with wc -m 9-easter_egg.py)
***10. Linked list cycle***
Technical interview preparation:
- You are not allowed to google anything
- Whiteboard first
- This task and all future technical interview prep tasks will include checks for the efficiency of your solution, i.e. is your solutions runtime fast enough, does your solution require extra memory usage / mallocs, etc.
- Write a function in C that checks if a singly linked list has a cycle in it.
- Prototype: int check_cycle(listint_t *list);
- Return: 0 if there is no cycle, 1 if there is a cycle
Requirements:
- Only these functions are allowed: write, printf, putchar, puts, malloc, free
***11. Hello, write***
Write a Python script that prints exactly and that piece of art is useful - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19, followed by a new line.
- Use the function write from the sys module
- You are not allowed to use print
- Your script should print to stderr
- Your script should exit with the status code 1
- (Dora Korpar was a Holberton student in Cohort 0 of San Francisco)
***12. Compile***
- Write a script that compiles a Python script file.
- The Python file name will be stored in the environment variable $PYFILE
- The output filename has to be $PYFILEc (ex: export PYFILE=my_main.py => output filename: my_main.pyc)
***13. ByteCode -> Python #1***
- Write the Python function def magic_calculation(a, b): that does exactly the same as the following Python bytecode:
